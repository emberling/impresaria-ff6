# impresaria-ff6

a work in progress (not yet functional) GUI tool for extracting and inserting custom music and samples into Final Fantasy VI ROMs. As of this writing you can open ROMs, demo included samples, and play included songs. Saving/loading projects and importing or exporting songs/samples are not yet implemented.

Requires snesapu.dll from https://github.com/dgrfactory/spcplay/ -- not currently included. Other forks of Alpha-II SNESAPU might also work.

Windows only for now, unfortunately.
Uses pyimgui (dear imgui) and pygame.
